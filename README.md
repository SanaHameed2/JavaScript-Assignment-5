## 📘 What I Learned

I learned how to use basic math operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus  
I used variables to store values and updated them using increment and decrement  
I used loops to create dynamic output like a multiplication table  
I applied real-life formulas in JavaScript such as currency conversion, shopping cart totals, and percentage calculations  
I practiced combining multiple operations in a single expression  
I used `prompt()` to take user input and `document.writeln()` to display results in the browser
